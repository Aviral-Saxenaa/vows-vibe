# 🚀 Deployment Guide for Vows Vibe

## ✅ **Fixed Vercel 404 Issues**

The 404 errors were caused by client-side routing configuration. Here's what I fixed:

### **1. Updated vercel.json**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **2. Updated vite.config.ts**
- Changed `outDir` from `"dist/spa"` to `"dist"`
- This ensures Vercel looks in the correct directory

### **3. Updated package.json**
- Changed build script from complex server build to simple `"vite build"`
- Added preview script for local testing

### **4. Added Fallback Files**
- `public/_redirects` - For Netlify compatibility
- `netlify.toml` - Alternative deployment option

## 🔧 **How to Deploy**

### **Vercel (Recommended)**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repo to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite project
4. Deploy! ✅

### **Manual Deployment Steps**
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Upload the `dist` folder contents
3. Configure your hosting to serve `index.html` for all routes

### **Alternative Platforms**

**Netlify:**
- Use the included `netlify.toml` file
- Drag & drop the `dist` folder

**GitHub Pages:**
- Use GitHub Actions with Vite deployment
- Set base path if using custom domain

## 🎯 **Testing Deployment**

After deployment, test these routes:
- `/` - Homepage ✅
- `/products` - Product catalog ✅
- `/product/1` - Product detail ✅
- `/cart` - Shopping cart ✅
- `/login` - Authentication ✅

All routes should work without 404 errors!

## 🔍 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **404 on Page Refresh**
